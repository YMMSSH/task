### 2. Data narrative
As a data professional, I infuse my dashboard with a storytelling element. You also craft a narrative through the data, making the insights not only useful, but engaging as well. So that the customer can make critical decisions so I focused on providing strategically useful insights for business success.

### 3. Dataset: Food Satisfaction
The dataset provided for this project is called “Food Satisfaction”. It contains valuable information related to customer reviews, ratings and different aspects of the dining experience.

## Bonus Challenge: Predictive analytics using machine learning
I explored predictive analytics using machine learning (ML) to predict user satisfaction based on their ratings using prediction models and experimented with three of them (### SVC - RandomForest - LogisticRegression) which realted with more than one feature.
